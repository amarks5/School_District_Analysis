# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of school district analysis
The overall goal was to run an analysis on the school districts math and reading scores. After our first analysis of the data the district noticed the standardized test scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School were inaccurate. In order to fix this, We were asked to replace scores at Thomas High School with NaN's to hopefully cut back on inaccurate readings of the data. The overall purpose of running this analysis was to look at student scores, school spending and budgeting of schools. Overall, the data was not affected significantly due to the low number of NaN's needing to be replaced.
### Results

#### How is the school summary affected?

  *The average math and reading scores for Thomas High School increased

  *The overall passing percentage for Thomas High School decreased
  
  *Thomas High School remained second best performing school in the district

#### How does replacing ninth graders; math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?

  *Replacing the math and reading scores with NaN's really doesn't affect their overall performance. Overall Thomas High School is still ranked second amongst all the high schools based on their performance.

#### How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
 *Math and reading scores by grade: The math and reading scores by grade remained unchanged.
 
 *Scores by school spending: The spending ranges for passing percentages were affected. In the spending range of $630-644 there was a 6% decrease in the math passing percentage, 7% decrease in passing reading percentage and a decrease of 6% for overall passing.
 
 *Scores by school size: Originally, medium-sized schools had the highest performance rate but after the data was removed they dropped to the second school size in performance. The passing percentages (math, reading and overall) for medium-sized schools were affected (dropped by 6% each).
 
 *Scores by school type: Before the data change, charter schools had a significant drop in passing rates. Originally charter schools passing rates by subject were as follows: 94% passing math, 97% passing reading and an overall passing rate of 90%. After the data change the passing rates are as follows: math and reading passing rates dropped 4% and the overall passing rate dropped to 87%.
 
## Summary
Due to the academic dishonesty, having to remove the ninth grade data and replace it with NaN's it causes Thomas High School to lose it's place amongst the top schools in the district. Overall, there is a decrease in the performance scores and percentages. However, when we updated the total counts to exclude the ninth graders it allows Thomas High School to recover it's second place position over all schools in the district.
